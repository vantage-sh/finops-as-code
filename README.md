## What Is FinOps as Code?

This repository contains tutorials and demos for implementing _FinOps as Code_ in your organization.

FinOps as Code is the integration of financial operations (FinOps) principles with modern cloud-native practices. FinOps as Code encourages practitioners to manage cloud costs and optimize spending patterns in a programmatic and automated manner.

Like its close cousin, Infrastructure as Code, FinOps as Code supports automation scripts and cloud-native technologies so that organizations can implement FinOps practices directly into their software development lifecycle.
