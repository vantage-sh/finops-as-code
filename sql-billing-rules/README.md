## What are SQL Billing Rules?
This repository provides a collection of custom billing rules written in Structured Query Language (SQL) for use with Vantage's MSP platform. These rules enable Managed Service Providers to apply tailored billing adjustments across customer accounts, including:

- Re-rating services to public pricing
- Excluding specific line items (e.g., discounts, credits)
- Applying one-time charges or credits
- Removing Savings Plan or Reserved Instance (SP/RI) discounts
- Recalculating tiered pricing models

For more information, refer to the [Vantage MSP Documentation](https://docs.vantage.sh/partners/#custom-billing-rule).
